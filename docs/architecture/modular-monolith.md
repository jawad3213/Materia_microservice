# Modular monolith: boundaries and the path to services

The backend is one deployable, but its bounded contexts are kept separable so each group can become its own
service. `ModuleBoundariesTest` (ArchUnit) fails the build when a rule below is broken, and `DataOwnershipTest` fails
it when a SQL or JPQL query names another context's table or entity.

## Target services

| Service | Contexts | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| API gateway | `gateway` | Validates JWTs, routes, rate-limits, traces (`X-Gateway-Trace-Id`). |
| Identity | `auth`, `employee` | Issues RS256 tokens (`TokenIssuer`) and publishes their public key at `/.well-known/jwks.json`; owns users and employees. |
| Master data | `masterData` | Materials, categories, suppliers, stock levels. |
| Procurement | `purchaseRequisition`, `purchaseOrder`, `goodsReceipt`, `returnToVendor` | One flow: PR → PO → GR → RTV. |
| Finance | `invoice`, `payment`, `settings` | Three-way match, payments, and the settings they use (price tolerance). |
| Analytics | `dashboard` (`analytics` planned) | Read-only. The dashboard composes each service's reporting use case (API composition); event-fed read models can replace calls where needed. |
| Notification (planned) | `notification` | Reacts to events. |

`common` is the shared kernel (money, currencies, base types, document code sequences, the outbox and inbox, the
change history, attachments, FX valuation). It is a library: each extracted service gets its own copy and its own
`global_code_sequences`, `outbox_messages`, `processed_events`, `audit_log`, `attachments` and `exchange_rates`
tables. The shared code names no context's table; each context plugs its own data in:

| Shared feature | What each context provides |
|---|---|
| Change history | `@Audited` on its own JPA entities (history type, code, parent, read permission). |
| Attachments | An `AttachmentOwnerLookup` per document type it owns (does the document exist?). |
| FX valuation | A `SqlDocumentFxStore` per document type it owns (its table, amount and date). |
| User names | `UserDisplayNames`, provided by identity (`AuthUserDisplayNames`). |

## Modules (`backend/`)

`backend/pom.xml` is the parent of every module. Build and test everything from `backend/` with `./mvnw test`; run
the application with `./mvnw -pl monolith -am spring-boot:run`.

| Module | Holds | Depends on |
|---|---|---|
| `materia-common` | The shared kernel above (`com.materia.backend.common`). | Spring, JPA, Kafka |
| `materia-grpc` | The contracts between services (`src/main/proto/materia/<service>/v1`), the stubs generated from them (`com.materia.proto.*`), and the interceptors every service installs (`com.materia.grpc.*`). | `materia-common`, grpc-java |
| `monolith` | Every context and the gateway: today's deployable. Services leave it one at a time; what remains becomes the procurement service. | `materia-common` (and `materia-grpc` once gRPC is wired) |

### gRPC contracts

Each contract mirrors a public lookup use case and its view, field for field. Only reads cross services by gRPC;
a change in another service (stock, replenishment requisitions) travels as an event.

| Contract (server) | Mirrors | Callers |
|---|---|---|
| `identity.v1.UserDirectory` | `UserDirectoryUseCase` (`findUser`, `findUsersWithRole`) | procurement, finance |
| `masterdata.v1.MaterialCatalog` | the reads of `MaterialInventoryUseCase` | procurement |
| `procurement.v1.PurchaseOrderLookup` | `PurchaseOrderLookupUseCase` | finance |
| `procurement.v1.GoodsReceiptLookup` | `GoodsReceiptLookupUseCase` | finance |
| `procurement.v1.Replenishment` | `ReplenishmentUseCase.hasOpenRequisitionFor` | master data |

Conventions: ids are UUID strings, amounts are `common.v1.Money` (a decimal string and a currency), dates are ISO
strings, and a lookup that finds nothing returns an empty `optional` field. A field number is never reused; a
breaking change is a new package version (`v2`).

Interceptors every service installs (`materia-grpc`):

| Side | Interceptor | Does |
|---|---|---|
| Client | `CallerTokenClientInterceptor` | Sends the user's token, so the called service applies that user's rights. |
| Client | `TraceIdClientInterceptor` | Sends the trace id of the request being served. |
| Client | `DefaultDeadlineClientInterceptor` | Gives a call without a deadline a default one. |
| Server | `AuthenticationServerInterceptor` | Refuses a call without a valid token (`UNAUTHENTICATED`) and exposes the caller (`GrpcCaller`). |
| Server | `TraceIdServerInterceptor` | Logs the call under the caller's trace id. |
| Server | `ExceptionTranslatingServerInterceptor` | Turns the shared exceptions into status codes; `GrpcErrors.toException` turns them back on the client. |


## Rules

1. **A context's `domain` and `application` layers know no other context and no gateway.** They reach the
   outside through their own outbound ports (`domain/ports/out`) with their own value types.
2. **Other code uses a context only through its public API:** `domain.ports.in`, `application.dtos`, and the
   `domain.enums`, `domain.events` and `domain.exceptions` those expose. In practice only infrastructure
   adapters (`infrastructure/adapters/out/<other context>`) and the gateway do this.
3. **`common` knows no context.**
4. **A Spring listener (`@EventListener`, `@TransactionalEventListener`) only handles its own context's events.**
   Another context's events are handled by an `IntegrationEventHandler` on their JSON payload, as they will be when
   they arrive from another service.

## How a cross-context call is wired

```
goodsReceipt.application.GoodsReceiptService
   └─ OrderedGoods                     (goodsReceipt/domain/ports/out, GR-owned records)
        └─ PurchaseOrderGoodsAdapter   (goodsReceipt/infrastructure/adapters/out/purchaseOrder)
             └─ PurchaseOrderLookupUseCase / PurchaseOrderReceivingUseCase   (purchaseOrder public API)
```

To extract a service, replace the adapter's body with a gRPC client (or an event consumer); the service and its
tests do not change.

Public lookups added for this purpose:

| Context | Public use cases |
|---|---|
| auth | `UserDirectoryUseCase` (`UserSummary`), `AccountProvisioningUseCase` |
| masterData | `MaterialInventoryUseCase` (`MaterialReference`, `StockMovement`) |
| purchaseRequisition | `ReplenishmentUseCase`, `RequisitionUseCase` (`RequisitionLineSummary`) |
| purchaseOrder | `PurchaseOrderLookupUseCase` (`PurchaseOrderView`), `PurchaseOrderReceivingUseCase` |
| goodsReceipt | `GoodsReceiptLookupUseCase` (`GoodsReceiptView`) |
| returnToVendor | `ReplacementQuantitiesUseCase` |

Reporting use cases (each computes its own figures on its own data; the dashboard composes them):
`RequisitionMetricsUseCase`, `PurchaseOrderMetricsUseCase`, `GoodsReceiptMetricsUseCase`, `InvoiceMetricsUseCase`,
`PaymentMetricsUseCase`, `MaterialMetricsUseCase`, `ReturnMetricsUseCase`.

In tests, `support/fixtures/CrossContextWiring` builds the real adapter and use case over the other context's
mocked repositories, so service tests keep stubbing what they always did.

## Events, the outbox and the inbox

- Every `DomainEvent` published through Spring is also written to `outbox_messages` in the same transaction
  (`OutboxRecorder`): it is stored if and only if the change commits. Events are always published through Spring,
  whatever `app.messaging.type` is; nothing sends to Kafka directly.
- `OutboxRelay` publishes pending messages to Kafka, oldest first, on `materia.<context>.events`, keyed by
  aggregate id, in an envelope `{eventId, eventType, sourceContext, aggregateId, occurredAt, payload}`. Delivery is
  at least once. Enable it with `app.outbox.relay.enabled=true` and `app.messaging.type=kafka` (tuning:
  `app.outbox.relay.interval-ms`, `batch-size`, `send-timeout-ms`).
- A context reacts to another context's events with an `IntegrationEventHandler`: it reads the envelope's JSON
  payload, never the publisher's Java class, so it works unchanged once the publisher is a separate service.
  `IntegrationEventDispatcher` runs each handler in its own transaction and records the event in
  `processed_events` (the inbox) in that transaction: a repeated delivery is skipped, a failed one is retried.
- Delivery today is in-process, after the publisher's commit (`InProcessIntegrationEvents`). With
  `app.messaging.type=kafka`, `KafkaIntegrationEventConsumer` also consumes `materia.*.events` (raw JSON, no type
  information from messages); the inbox makes the double delivery harmless. An extracted service sets
  `app.events.in-process.enabled=false` and receives only from Kafka. Tests use `app.events.in-process.mode=immediate`
  (inside the test transaction); `IntegrationEventsIT` and `ReceiptStockEventsIT` check the after-commit delivery.
- Events must stay plain data (strings, numbers, ids, enums): they are serialized to JSON.

### Procurement and master data

Procurement changes stock only through events; master data applies them:

| Event (publisher) | Handler (consumer) | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `StockOnOrderChanged` (purchaseOrder) | `StockOnOrderHandler` (masterData) | Adds or releases stock on order. |
| `GoodsReceiptLineReceived` (goodsReceipt) | `ReceivedGoodsStockHandler` (masterData) | Accepted goods enter stock; the received quantity leaves stock on order. |
| `ReceiptStockApplied` (masterData) | `ReceiptStockLevelsHandler` (goodsReceipt) | The receipt line records the stock before and after. |

Procurement still reads master data synchronously (material lookups, which become gRPC calls), and master data
raises replenishment requisitions in procurement (one direction). No transaction spans the two.

## Not done yet

- **One database schema per service.** No foreign key and no query crosses a service boundary (`DataOwnershipTest`),
  but all tables are still in `public`. Moving them (`alter table ... set schema`) relocates live data and needs the
  migration tests reworked, so it is a separate, deliberate step.
- **The extraction itself:** a build and image per service, gateway routing to them, and service-to-service
  authentication. Each cross-context adapter (`infrastructure/adapters/out/<context>`) becomes a gRPC client; the
  services and their tests do not change.
- `RequisitionOutput.getLines()` still exposes requisition entities to the requisition web layer; other
  contexts must use `getLineSummaries()`.
- **Writes that still cross services synchronously.** Returned goods go back on order through
  `MaterialInventoryUseCase.addStockOnOrder` (`ProcurementReturnSources`), and master data raises replenishment
  requisitions through `ReplenishmentUseCase.raise*`. Both become events before their services are split.
- **The dashboard's metrics** have no gRPC contract yet: about thirty fine-grained calls, which an event-fed read
  model in analytics may replace. Decided when analytics is extracted.
- **Dev seeders** call other contexts directly; each service will seed its own data.
