# Materia on AWS EC2 (staging and prod)

Each environment is one EC2 instance running the app with docker compose:

```
Browser ──HTTP :80──▶ EC2 (Amazon Linux 2023, Elastic IP)
                       └─ docker compose
                           frontend (nginx: SPA + proxy /api) ─▶ backend (Spring Boot) ─▶ postgres
                                                                                  data on EBS /data, daily snapshots

GitHub Actions ──OIDC──▶ deploy role ──▶ ECR (push images)
                                     └─▶ SSM Run Command on the instance ─▶ deploy.sh
EC2 instance role ──▶ ECR (pull) + Parameter Store /materia/<env>/app/* (config + secrets)
Admins ──▶ SSM Session Manager (no SSH key, no port 22)
```

```

`main.tf`, `variables.tf` and `outputs.tf` are identical in both environments; the differences are in
`terraform.tfvars`, `backend.hcl` and the state key in `providers.tf`.

## First setup

Requirements: Terraform >= 1.10, AWS CLI v2 with admin credentials for the account, and the
[Session Manager plugin](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/session-manager-working-with-install-plugin.html) to open shells.

1. **Bootstrap** (once per account, local state):
   ```bash
   cd aws/bootstrap
   cp terraform.tfvars.example terraform.tfvars   # set a unique state_bucket_name
   terraform init && terraform apply
   ```
   Note the outputs `state_bucket_name` and `github_oidc_provider_arn`.

2. **Staging** (then the same for `prod`):
   ```bash
   cd aws/environments/staging
   cp backend.hcl.example backend.hcl             # bucket = state_bucket_name
   cp terraform.tfvars.example terraform.tfvars   # github_oidc_provider_arn, sizes, mail settings...
   terraform init -backend-config=backend.hcl
   terraform plan -out=tfplan && terraform apply tfplan
   ```

3. **GitHub**: in *Settings → Environments*, create `staging` and `production` and add the variables
   printed by `terraform output github_environment_variables`:
   - `AWS_DEPLOY_ROLE_ARN`
   - `AWS_REGION`

   Add required reviewers to `production` to gate prod deploys.

4. **Deploy**: push to `staging`/`develop` (staging) or `main` (prod), or run the workflow by hand.
   The workflow builds and tests, pushes `materia-<env>-backend|frontend:<sha>` to ECR, finds the instance by
   its tags and runs `deploy.sh` through SSM. If the backend is not healthy, the script rolls back to the
   previous tag and the job fails.

5. **First sign-in**: the database starts empty and Flyway builds the whole schema on the first start
   (Hibernate only validates it). No account is seeded: with `bootstrap_admin_email` set, the backend creates
   that administrator from a password Terraform generated. Read it with the command printed by
   `terraform output -raw bootstrap_admin_password_command`, sign in, and choose a new password.

## Day to day

| Task | Command |
|---|---|
| Shell on the instance | `terraform output -raw ssm_session_command` then run it |
| Logs | in the session: `cd /opt/materia && sudo docker compose logs -f backend` |
| Change a setting | edit `app_config` / `extra_secrets` in `terraform.tfvars`, `terraform apply`, then redeploy |
| Read a parameter | `aws ssm get-parameter --name /materia/staging/app/APP_LOGIN_URL` |
| Redeploy the same commit | re-run the workflow |
| Bootstrap log | `/var/log/materia-bootstrap.log` on the instance |

## Attachment files in S3

Procurement and finance keep attachment files on the data volume by default (`/data/attachments` and
`/data/finance-attachments`). They can keep them in S3 instead: one bucket, each service under its own prefix. Only
the files move; their metadata stays in each service's `attachments` table.

A file's S3 key is its path under the old directory with the service's prefix in front
(`/data/attachments/purchase_order/<id>/<file>.pdf` becomes `procurement/purchase_order/<id>/<file>.pdf`), so moving an
environment's existing files is a copy:

1. Create the bucket (private, default encryption, versioning recommended) and give each service's role
   `s3:PutObject`, `s3:GetObject` and `s3:DeleteObject` on its own prefix only (`arn:aws:s3:::<bucket>/procurement/*`,
   `arn:aws:s3:::<bucket>/finance/*`). On EC2 that is the instance role.
2. Copy the files, from a shell on the instance (temporary upload files are left behind):
   ```bash
   aws s3 sync /data/attachments          s3://<bucket>/procurement/ --exclude "*.upload-*"
   aws s3 sync /data/finance-attachments  s3://<bucket>/finance/     --exclude "*.upload-*"
   ```
3. Set, for procurement and finance, `APP_ATTACHMENTS_STORAGE=s3` and `APP_ATTACHMENTS_S3_BUCKET=<bucket>` (the
   prefixes default to `procurement/` and `finance/`; the region to `AWS_REGION`), and redeploy.
4. Run the same `aws s3 sync` again: files uploaded between steps 2 and 3 are copied too (sync skips the others).
5. Open a few attachments in the application. Keep the directories until you are sure; then they can go.

To go back, set `APP_ATTACHMENTS_STORAGE=local` and sync the other way (`aws s3 sync s3://<bucket>/procurement/
/data/attachments`).

## Secrets

- The PostgreSQL password, both JWT keys and the first administrator's password are generated by Terraform and
  stored as SecureString.
  Mail and exchange-rate keys go in `extra_secrets` in `terraform.tfvars`.
- `terraform.tfvars`, `backend.hcl`, state files and saved plans are git-ignored. Only `*.example` files are
  tracked.
- SecureString values are also in the Terraform state, which is why the state bucket is private, encrypted,
  versioned and TLS-only.
- Rotating the JWT keys signs everyone out:
  ```bash
  terraform apply -replace=tls_private_key.jwt
  ```
  Then redeploy.

## HTTPS

The stack serves plain HTTP on the Elastic IP. To serve HTTPS:

1. Point a DNS record at `public_ip`.
2. Terminate TLS on the host, e.g. with a Caddy or certbot container in front of the frontend.
3. Set `enable_https = true`, `app_url = "https://your.domain"` and `refresh_cookie_secure = true`.
4. Run `terraform apply` and redeploy.

Keep `refresh_cookie_secure = false` while the site is HTTP, otherwise browsers drop the refresh cookie.

## Replacing the instance

`ami` and `user_data` changes are ignored so a running host is never replaced by accident. To move to a new
AMI, run:

```bash
terraform apply -replace=module.ec2.aws_instance.app
```

The data volume survives and is re-mounted at `/data`. Then redeploy.
